In the previous lecture, we introduced a class `shape_wrapper` that could, to some extent, function as a smart pointer. By using this “smart pointer,” resource management can be simplified, fundamentally eliminating the possibility of resource (including memory) leaks. In this lecture, we’ll take it a step further and demonstrate how to evolve `shape_wrapper` into a fully functional smart pointer. You’ll see that a smart pointer is essentially a natural extension of RAII for resource management.

## Recap

Here’s the class we introduced in the previous lecture:

```cpp
class shape_wrapper {
public:
  explicit shape_wrapper(shape* ptr = nullptr): ptr_(ptr) {}

  ~shape_wrapper(){
    delete ptr_;
  }

  shape* get() const { return ptr_; }

private:
  shape* ptr_;
};
```

This class achieves the most basic function of a smart pointer: releasing objects that go out of scope. However, it’s missing a few things:
1. The class only works for the `shape` type.
2. The class does not behave like a true pointer.
3. Copying objects of this class can lead to unexpected program behavior.

Next, let’s examine how to address these issues one by one.

## Templates and Usability

To make our class capable of wrapping pointers of any type, we need to turn it into a class template. This is fairly straightforward:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class smart_ptr {
public:
  explicit smart_ptr(T* ptr = nullptr): ptr_(ptr) {}

  ~smart_ptr() {
    delete ptr_;
  }

  T* get() const { return ptr_; }
private:
  T* ptr_;
};
```

Compared to `shape_wrapper`, we simply added a `template` declaration `template <typename T>` at the beginning and replaced the `shape` type with the template parameter `T`. These changes are simple and intuitive, demonstrating that templates are not inherently complex. Using this template is also easy—just replace `shape_wrapper` with `smart_ptr<shape>`.

However, the current `smart_ptr` still behaves differently from regular pointers:
1. It cannot be dereferenced using the `*` operator.
2. It cannot use the `->` operator to access members of the pointed-to object.
3. It cannot be used in boolean expressions like a regular pointer.

These issues can be resolved easily by adding a few member functions:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class smart_ptr {
public:
  ...
  T& operator*() const { return *ptr_; }
  T* operator->() const { return ptr_; }
  operator bool() const { return ptr_; }
};
```

## Copy Constructor and Assignment

Handling copy construction and assignment (collectively referred to as “copying”) is a bit more complicated. The challenge lies not in implementation but in defining the desired behavior. Consider the following code:

```cpp
smart_ptr<shape> ptr1{create_shape(shape_type::circle)};
smart_ptr<shape> ptr2{ptr1};
```

For the second line, should we cause a compilation error, or allow some reasonable behavior? Let’s examine the possibilities.

The simplest approach is to prohibit copying:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class smart_ptr {
  ...
  smart_ptr(const smart_ptr&) = delete;
  smart_ptr& operator=(const smart_ptr&) = delete;
  ...
};
```

Disabling these functions is straightforward and prevents a class of potential errors. Otherwise, `smart_ptr<shape> ptr2{ptr1}`; would compile but result in undefined behavior at runtime, typically causing a crash due to double deletion of the same memory.


Could we consider copying the pointed-to object instead? No, this is generally not desirable because smart pointers are meant to reduce object copying. Moreover, while our pointer type is `shape`, it likely points to objects of derived types like `circle` or `triangle`. C++ does not have a universal equivalent to Java’s `clone` method, and there’s no general way to create a subclass object from a base class pointer.


Could we transfer ownership during copying? This can be implemented as follows:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class smart_ptr {
  ...
  smart_ptr(smart_ptr& other) {
    ptr_ = other.release();
  }
  smart_ptr& operator=(smart_ptr& rhs) {
    smart_ptr(rhs).swap(*this);
    return *this;
  }
  ...
  T* release() {
    T* ptr = ptr_;
    ptr_ = nullptr;
    return ptr;
  }
  void swap(smart_ptr& rhs) {
    using std::swap;
    swap(ptr_, rhs.ptr_);
  }
  ...
};
```

In the copy constructor, ownership is transferred by calling `release` on the `other` object. In the assignment operator, a temporary object is created using the copy constructor, and ownership is swapped using swap.


You might have encountered assignment operator implementations with a conditional check like `if (this != &rhs)`. That approach is verbose and lacks strong exception safety—if an exception occurs during assignment, the state of the current object (this) may be partially corrupted.

The idiom shown above ensures strong exception safety. Assignment is divided into two steps: copy construction and swap. An exception can only occur in the first step. If an exception happens during the copy construction, the current object (this) remains unaffected. Thus, the object’s state is either successfully updated or unchanged.

If you find this implementation acceptable, congratulations—you’ve reached the level of the C++ committee in 1998. The semantics here essentially define the `auto_ptr` class in C++98. However, if you think this implementation feels awkward, congratulations again—the C++ committee felt the same way. As a result, `auto_ptr` was officially removed from the C++ standard in C++17.


The main issue with the above implementation is that it makes it easy for programmers to make mistakes. If you inadvertently pass ownership to another `smart_ptr`, you lose access to the object…


## “Move” Semantics for Smart Pointers

In the next section, we’ll provide a complete introduction to move semantics. For now, let’s take a brief look at how `smart_ptr` can leverage “move” semantics to improve their behavior.

We need to make two small modifications to the code:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class smart_ptr {
  ...
  smart_ptr(smart_ptr&& other) {  // Move constructor
    ptr_ = other.release();
  }
  smart_ptr& operator=(smart_ptr rhs) {  // Assignment operator
    rhs.swap(*this);
    return *this;
  }
  ...
};
```

What’s Changed?
* The parameter type of the copy constructor was changed from `smart_ptr&` to `smart_ptr&&`. This makes it a move constructor.
* The parameter type of the assignment operator was changed from `smart_ptr&` to `smart_ptr`. This allows the function to directly generate a new smart pointer during construction, eliminating the need to create a temporary object within the function. The behavior of the assignment operator—whether it involves a move or a copy—depends entirely on whether the constructor invoked is the move constructor or copy constructor.


According to C++ rules, if a move constructor is provided and a copy constructor is not explicitly defined, the latter is automatically disabled. As a result, the following behavior is naturally achieved:

``` cpp
smart_ptr<shape> ptr1{create_shape(shape_type::circle)};
smart_ptr<shape> ptr2{ptr1};             // Compilation error
smart_ptr<shape> ptr3;
ptr3 = ptr1;                             // Compilation error
ptr3 = std::move(ptr1);                  // OK, ownership is transferred
smart_ptr<shape> ptr4{std::move(ptr3)};  // OK, ownership is transferred
```

This behavior is intuitive and aligns with the basic behavior of `std::unique_ptr` in C++11.


## Converting Subclass to Base Class Pointers

You may have noticed that while a `circle*` can implicitly convert to a `shape*`, a `smart_ptr<circle>` cannot automatically convert to a `smart_ptr<shape>`. This behavior is less “natural.”

To address this, we only need to add a template constructor to the implementation. Here’s the modification:

```cpp
template <typename U>
smart_ptr(smart_ptr<U>&& other) {
  ptr_ = other.release();
}
```

By adding this, we naturally utilize pointer conversion properties. Now, a `smart_ptr<circle>` can be moved to a `smart_ptr<shape>` but not to a `smart_ptr<triangle>`. Invalid conversions will result in compilation errors.

Note: This template constructor is not considered a move constructor by the compiler, so it doesn’t automatically disable the copy constructor. To avoid redundant code or to explicitly prohibit copy construction, you can mark the copy constructor as `= delete` (as discussed in the “Copy Constructor and Assignment” section). For a more general solution, both standard copy/move constructors and template constructors should be explicitly defined.


## Reference Counting for Shared Ownership

While `unique_ptr` provides safe smart pointer functionality, it limits ownership to a single pointer, which isn’t suitable for all use cases. A common scenario is when multiple smart pointers share ownership of the same object, and the object is deleted only when all of them are destroyed. This is the basis of `shared_ptr`.

The main differences between `unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr` are illustrated below:

![unique_ptr vs shared_ptr](images/cpp-02-01.webp)


Multiple `shared_ptr` instances can share ownership of the same object. Shared pointers need to maintain a reference count, which is shared among all instances pointing to the same object. The last `shared_ptr` to release the object is responsible for deleting it and the reference count.


We begin by implementing a shared_count class:

``` cpp
class shared_count {
public:
  shared_count();
  void add_count();
  long reduce_count();
  long get_count() const;
};
```

The class provides three methods: one to increment the count, one to decrement the count, and one to retrieve the current count. Incrementing doesn’t return a value, but decrementing does so that the caller can determine if this is the last `shared_ptr` pointing to the object.

For simplicity, we’ll implement a basic version without multithreading considerations:

``` cpp
class shared_count {
public:
  shared_count() : count_(1) {}
  void add_count() {
    ++count_;
  }
  long reduce_count() {
    return --count_;
  }
  long get_count() const {
    return count_;
  }

private:
  long count_;
};
```


Now we can implement our reference-counted smart pointer. First, let’s define the constructor, destructor, and private members:

``` cpp
template <typename T>
class smart_ptr {
public:
  explicit smart_ptr(T* ptr = nullptr): ptr_(ptr) {
    if (ptr) {
      shared_count_ = new shared_count();
    }
  }
  ~smart_ptr() {
    if (ptr_ && !shared_count_->reduce_count()) {
      delete ptr_;
      delete shared_count_;
    }
  }

private:
  T* ptr_;
  shared_count* shared_count_;
};
```

The constructor initializes a `shared_count` if the pointer is non-null. The destructor decreases the reference count and deletes the object and count when the reference count drops to zero.


To facilitate assignment and other operations, we add a `swap` function:

``` cpp
void swap(smart_ptr& rhs) {
  using std::swap;
  swap(ptr_, rhs.ptr_);
  swap(shared_count_, rhs.shared_count_);
}
```

The copy and move constructors need updates:

``` cpp
smart_ptr(const smart_ptr& other) {
  ptr_ = other.ptr_;
  if (ptr_) {
    other.shared_count_->add_count();
    shared_count_ = other.shared_count_;
  }
}

template <typename U>
smart_ptr(const smart_ptr<U>& other) {
  ptr_ = other.ptr_;
  if (ptr_) {
    other.shared_count_->add_count();
    shared_count_ = other.shared_count_;
  }
}

template <typename U>
smart_ptr(smart_ptr<U>&& other) {
  ptr_ = other.ptr_;
  if (ptr_) {
    shared_count_ = other.shared_count_;
    other.ptr_ = nullptr;
  }
}
```

For the copy constructor, we increment the reference count if the pointer is non-null and copy the shared count. For the move constructor, we transfer ownership by nullifying the original pointer and sharing the `shared_count`.


The code above has a problem: it won’t compile. 

The compiler throws an error because template instances don’t inherently have friend relationships with each other. This means they can’t access private members like `ptr_` and `shared_count_` across different template instantiations. To resolve this, we need to explicitly declare:

``` cpp
template <typename U>
friend class smart_ptr;
```


In the previous implementation, which resembled a single-ownership `unique_ptr`, we used `release` to manually transfer ownership. However, in the current reference-counting implementation, release is no longer suitable and should be removed.

Instead, we can add a function that is very useful for debugging: it returns the reference count. Here’s the definition:

``` cpp
long use_count() const {
  if (ptr_) {
    return shared_count_->get_count();
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}
```

This gives us a more complete implementation of a reference-counted smart pointer. Let’s test its functionality with the following code:

``` cpp
class shape {
public:
  virtual ~shape() {}
};

class circle : public shape {
public:
  ~circle() { puts("~circle()"); }
};

int main() {
  smart_ptr<circle> ptr1(new circle());
  printf("use count of ptr1 is %ld\n", ptr1.use_count());
  smart_ptr<shape> ptr2;
  printf("use count of ptr2 was %ld\n", ptr2.use_count());
  ptr2 = ptr1;
  printf("use count of ptr2 is now %ld\n", ptr2.use_count());
  if (ptr1) {
    puts("ptr1 is not empty");
  }
}
```

Expected Output

> use count of ptr1 is 1  
  use count of ptr2 was 0   
  use count of ptr2 is now 2    
  ptr1 is not empty   
  ~circle()

From this output, we can observe the changes in the reference count and confirm that the object is successfully deleted when the last `smart_ptr` instance goes out of scope.


## Pointer Type Conversion

In C++, we have different types of explicit type casts:
* static_cast
* reinterpret_cast
* const_cast
* dynamic_cast

Smart pointers should implement similar functionality through function templates. This isn’t particularly complex to implement, but enabling such conversions requires adding a constructor that accepts an existing smart pointer’s reference count when assigning the internal pointer. Here’s how it looks:

``` cpp
template <typename U>
smart_ptr(const smart_ptr<U>& other, T* ptr) {
  ptr_ = ptr;
  if (ptr_) {
    other.shared_count_->add_count();
    shared_count_ = other.shared_count_;
  }
}
```

Using this, we can implement a conversion function, such as `dynamic_pointer_cast`. Here’s an example:

``` cpp
template <typename T, typename U>
smart_ptr<T> dynamic_pointer_cast(const smart_ptr<U>& other) {
  T* ptr = dynamic_cast<T*>(other.get());
  return smart_ptr<T>(other, ptr);
}
```

To test this, add the following code after the previous test:

``` cpp
smart_ptr<circle> ptr3 = dynamic_pointer_cast<circle>(ptr2);
printf("use count of ptr3 is %ld\n", ptr3.use_count());
```

Additional Output

> use count of ptr3 is 3

The object will still be correctly deleted when the last smart_ptr instance is destroyed, demonstrating the correctness of our implementation.

```



## Summary

In this lesson, we started with a basic `shape_wrapper` implementation and built a reference-counted smart pointer. While our `smart_ptr` lacks some features compared to `std::shared_ptr`, it includes most of the commonly used functionalities. By now, you should have a deeper understanding of smart pointers and how they work.
